# Penta agent rules

## CLOUD AGENT BUILD POLICY

Routine validation must happen locally.

Before completing work, use the repository's normal commands for:

- install (`pnpm install --frozen-lockfile`)
- lint (`pnpm lint`)
- typecheck (`pnpm typecheck`)
- tests (`pnpm test`)
- production build (`pnpm build`)
- local browser QA (`pnpm dev` on port 43121)
- Playwright/screenshots if relevant (`pnpm qa:visual`)

Never use Vercel as a validation environment.

NEVER automatically execute:

- `vercel`
- `vercel deploy`
- `vercel --prod`
- `npx vercel`
- `pnpm vercel`
- `npm exec vercel`

Never call a Vercel Deploy Hook automatically.

Never create a Vercel deployment only to:

- check if code builds
- inspect design
- capture screenshots
- run QA
- test responsive behavior
- validate a small commit

A Vercel deployment must be intentional and explicitly requested.

## Branch policy

| Branch | Vercel |
| --- | --- |
| `main` / `master` | Production, only if the app is actually affected |
| `release/**` | Optional preview, only if the app is actually affected |
| `cursor/**`, `claude/**`, `codex/**`, `agent/**`, `qa/**`, `design/**`, `fix/**` | Local validation only |

Do not push routine agent work to `main` just to look at a preview. Validate locally, then release once.

See `docs/VERCEL_DEPLOY_POLICY.md`.
